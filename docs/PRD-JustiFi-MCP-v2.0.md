## 1. Executive Summary & Vision

### Mission Statement
Transform the JustiFi MCP server into the **premier payment tool platform** for AI-assisted development, providing atomic, composable tools that AI agents can orchestrate into sophisticated payment workflows.

### Strategic Positioning
- **MCP-Native**: Built for IDE integration from day one with proper MCP architectural principles
- **Atomic Tools**: Single-purpose, composable tools that agents orchestrate (not hardcoded workflows)
- **Payment-Specialized**: Deep JustiFi expertise with payment-optimized tool design
- **Developer-First**: Superior developer experience with modern tooling and practices
- **Agent-Centric**: Tools designed for AI agent composition, not human workflows

### Architectural Philosophy
**MCP servers provide tools, agents provide intelligence.** We build atomic, reliable tools that AI agents can combine creatively, rather than hardcoding business logic or workflows.

### 5.2 Tool Design Principles
**Atomic & Composable:**
```python
# ✅ Good: Single-purpose, composable tools
async def retrieve_payment(payment_id: str) -> dict:
    """Get one payment by ID"""
    
async def list_payments(limit: int = 25, after_cursor: str = None) -> dict:
    """List payments with pagination"""
    
async def create_refund(payment_id: str, amount_cents: int) -> dict:
    """Create refund for a payment"""

# ❌ Bad: Multi-step workflows (belongs in agent layer)
async def analyze_payment_health(date_range: str) -> dict:
    """Multi-step analysis workflow"""  # This is agent work!
```

### 5.3 Configuration System (Stripe-Inspired)
```python
from justifi_mcp import JustiFiToolkit

toolkit = JustiFiToolkit(
    client_id=os.getenv("JUSTIFI_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret=os.getenv("JUSTIFI_CLIENT_SECRET"),
    enabled_tools=[
        "retrieve_payment", "list_payments",  # Selective enabling
        "retrieve_payout", "list_payouts"
    ],
    context={
        "environment": "sandbox",     # or "production"
        "rate_limit": "standard",     # or "premium"  
        "timeout": 30                 # Request timeout
    }
)

# Framework-specific usage
mcp_server = toolkit.get_mcp_server()
langchain_tools = toolkit.get_langchain_tools()
```

- **Error Handling**: Actionable error messages with suggestions
- **Performance**: Consistent sub-second response times

### Testing Approach
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│    Integration Tests (20%)          │  Real API + framework testing
