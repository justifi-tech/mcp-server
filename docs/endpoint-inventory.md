## Implementation Roadmap

### Priority 2 (P2) - Advanced Read Operations ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Target: v1.3 - Q2 2025**

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Tool Name | Status |
|----------|--------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| `/disputes` | GET | List disputes | `list_disputes` | ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED |
| `/disputes/{id}` | GET | Retrieve dispute details | `retrieve_dispute` | ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED |
| `/checkouts` | GET | List checkouts | `list_checkouts` | ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED |
| `/checkouts/{id}` | GET | Retrieve checkout details | `retrieve_checkout` | ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED |

### Priority 3 (P3) - Creation Operations ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRIORITIZED
**Target: v2.0 - TBD**

**‚ö†Ô∏è COMPLEXITY WARNING**: All creation endpoints require extensive validation, error handling, and security considerations.

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Complexity | Risk Level |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|------------|
| `POST /payments` | POST | Create payment | **HIGH** | Security Critical |
| `POST /payments/{id}/refunds` | POST | Create refund | **HIGH** | Financial Impact |
| `POST /payment_methods` | POST | Create payment method | **HIGH** | PCI Compliance |
| `POST /payouts` | POST | Create payout | **HIGH** | Auto-generated by JustiFi |
| `POST /checkout_sessions` | POST | Create checkout session | **HIGH** | Complex State |

### Priority 4 (P4) - Complex/Specialized Operations
**Target: v2.1+ - Future**

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Complexity | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| `/platform_accounts` | GET | List platform accounts | High | Multi-tenant complexity |
| `/platform_accounts/{id}` | GET | Retrieve platform account | Medium | Account hierarchy |
| `/webhooks` | GET | List webhook endpoints | Medium | Event management |
| `/webhooks/{id}` | GET | Retrieve webhook details | Low | Standard read operation |

## API Endpoint Status Reference

### ‚úÖ Verified Working Endpoints (Safe to Use)
- All payment endpoints (`/payments`, `/payments/{id}`)
- All payout endpoints (`/payouts`, `/payouts/{id}`)
- Payment method endpoints (`/payment_methods/{token}`)
- All refund endpoints (`/refunds`, `/refunds/{id}`)
- Balance transaction endpoints (`/balance_transactions`, `/balance_transactions/{id}`)
- All dispute endpoints (`/disputes`, `/disputes/{id}`)
- All checkout endpoints (`/checkouts`, `/checkouts/{id}`)

### ‚ùå Known Non-Existent Endpoints (DO NOT IMPLEMENT)
- `GET /payment_methods` (list_payment_methods) - Endpoint doesn't exist
- `GET /balances` (retrieve_balance) - No dedicated balance endpoint
- `POST /payouts` (create_payout) - Payouts are auto-generated by JustiFi

### üîç Endpoints Requiring Verification
- `GET /platform_accounts` - May require special permissions
- `GET /webhooks` - Need to verify availability

## Strategic Focus: Read-Only First

**Current Strategy**: Prioritize read-only operations for safety and rapid value delivery.

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Lower Risk**: Read operations can't cause financial damage
- ‚úÖ **Faster Development**: No complex validation or security requirements  
- ‚úÖ **Immediate Value**: Users can query and analyze their JustiFi data
- ‚úÖ **Foundation Building**: Establishes patterns for future creation endpoints

**Next Steps**: Priority 2 advanced read operations are now complete! Ready to consider Priority 4 specialized operations or creation endpoints based on user needs.
