| `/payouts` | GET | List payouts | - | limit, cursors | 🎯 NEW |
| `/balance_transactions` | GET | Get balance info | - | - | 🎯 NEW (as retrieve_balance) |

## Priority 2 (P2) - Consider for v1.2
Useful but may require additional complexity or auth scoping.

## Priority 3 (P3) - Future consideration
Complex workflows, specialized use cases, or deprecated endpoints.

| Category | Endpoints | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Sub-accounts** | `/sub_accounts/*` | Multi-tenant complexity |
| **Entities** | `/entities/*` | KYC/verification workflows |
| **Terminals** | `/terminals/*` | Physical terminal management |
| **Reports** | `/reports/*` | Complex reporting system |
| **Insurance** | `/insurance/*` | Specialized insurance features |
| **Web Components** | `/web_component_tokens` | Frontend integration |
| **Deprecated** | `/reports/proceeds/{id}` | Marked deprecated |

## Current Implementation (v1.0)
✅ Already implemented in current MCP server:

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Tool Name |
|----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `/payments` | POST | Create payment | `create_payment` |
| `/payments/{id}` | GET | Retrieve payment | `retrieve_payment` |
| `/payments` | GET | List payments | `list_payments` |
| `/payments/{id}/refunds` | POST | Create refund | `refund_payment` |

## Implementation Notes
- All P1 endpoints follow existing OAuth2 + JSON patterns
- Payment methods use tokens instead of IDs for security
- **Payouts are read-only** - automatically generated by JustiFi, cannot be created via API
- Balance transactions endpoint can serve as "retrieve_balance" equivalent
- Idempotency keys supported where applicable
